Steps to run the api

Just clone the repository and open in your favourite code editor
in command line add "go run main.go" so the server is started on port 8080

For easy access go to postman and enter http://localhost:8080/"custom"
custom = user - to create a new user
         user/{id} - to get the user data
         post - to create a new post
         post/{id} - to retrive the post
         post/user/{id} - to get all post posted using that id

All the data is stored in Mongo db

Thank you:)
